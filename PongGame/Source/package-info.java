/**

 * 
 * A package that contains the classes for a Pong Game.
 * The a11rallypong package contains eleven java classes. A base class has two derived classes called ball and paddle.
 * These classes are employed on a JFrame to represent two paddles rallying a ball
 * back and forth. There are multiple GUIs for this application; a Main Menu, High Scores window and a Game Over window
 * which were all built via window builder. The package also has a class that reads from and writes to a file
 * the highscores achieved by players.
